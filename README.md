# Active labeling: Streaming stochastic gradients

## TODO: 
- Implement SGD for least square and mean absolute deviation.
- Implement synthetic problems for regression.
- Implement synthetic problems for classification.
- Implement problem based on LIBSVM.

## Comparison
- Median versus least-square surrogate comparison
- Active versus passive weakly supervised learning.
   Randomly collect data, vs actively collect them
- Illustration of the active learning procedure in 1d, with Y gaussian N(f(x), 1)
